<h4 id="first-week">First week</h4>
<p>I just finished finals and I'm about to get into gear to start my project with the Blue Brain. This week I'm trying to figure out how to get their latest Neuromapp program forked into my gsoc directory, and ensure that I haven't forgotten all of the C++ I ever learned.</p>
<p>Had a fun week watching other people freaking out with the endings of finals, and the graduation ceremonies happening all over town.</p>
<p>On a project related note, I also managed for setup a fork to Neuromapp, and an upstream connection to the original repo. In the process of building the neuromapp I realized how little I know about the use of CMake, so there's been a ton of reading involved so far. My manager also sent me his container that I will be experimenting with compression strategies on. Part of the day went to making sure that I could compile that, and do a little looking around inside the code.</p>
<p>I had a fun little moment yesterday when I tried to push a commit that had included my build directory. Both my manager, and git immediately jumped on me haha! Ok, lesson learned. This morning I fixed that up and made a few additions so now the start of my compression mini-app for neuromapp has begun.</p>
<p>I'm currently a little bit stuck on how to include the suite of boost tests that my mentor has passed on to me, but he says that stuff can wait.</p>
<p>Next week I'll be working on getting some tests for the user command line interface up and running, and trying to get more and more familiar with the basic state of the project as it exists outside of my contributions.</p>
<p>Stay posted!</p>
<h4 id="second-week----the-prefetchperfect-week">Second week -- The Prefetch/perfect week</h4>
<p>This week I got to move a little further along with setting a foundation for the compression work to come. I double checked that neuromapp could still compile with last weeks changes. Additionally, I wrote a custom cmake compile script that would exclude the mini-apps not needed to test changes made to the compression app. With this I can modify compression app code and compile to check without having to wait for the whole program to rebuild.</p>
<p>I then tried to run some of my manager's tests for the block structure. I had to modify Cmakelists in various subdirectories to get neuromapp to acknowledge the tests, but currently they are giving me the green light. It's taking a little bit of time to parse the boost::mpl templating that Tim is using for the unit_testing but I think our most recent conversation has cleared up most of my lingering questions.</p>
<p>Later in the week I started coding the boost::program_options functions that are necessary to use the block through the neuromapp command line interface. It took a little bit of time to read up on how to do this, but the end result is very nice. I then attached the zlib compression library functionality, and created a demo option for the neuromapp compression tool. This demo uses a string buffer as a compression object and prints out its size in memory before and after compression. This is in some sense a metaphorical hello world compression exercise.</p>
<p>Following this progress my mentor suggested that I make sure I feel completely comfortable with the code supporting our block memory object, and so I spent a day revisiting the code. Upon reading my update email for the day Tim said that at some point he needed a prefect function. This I took to mean a &quot;perfect&quot; function which I'm convinced will never exist no matter how clever the programmer is. Needless to say I was a little freaked out by how high the bar was getting set, so I wrote back asking if he was joking. He corrected my misunderstanding by explaining that a &quot;prefetch&quot; function is what he meant. If you're wondering this is essentially a function that helps to make sure that data needed for computation is within reach when its needed; if you have a sense for it, this can provide significant optimizations for your program. After learning about this, I went about creating a number of examples to cemente my understanding.</p>
<p>That about wraps it up for this week!</p>
<p>Until next time</p>
