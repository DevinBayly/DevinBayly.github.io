## In memory compression for neuroinformatics applications
##### First week #####

I just finished finals and I'm about to get into gear to start my project with the Blue Brain. This week I'm trying to figure out how to get their latest Neuromapp program forked into my gsoc directory, and ensure that I haven't forgotten all of the C++ I ever learned.

Stay posted!
